An app for managing a pair-programming classroom.

## ChangeLog

## 0.0.14

- Make bottom navigation icons visible.

- Make undoing team reverse the fixing of the default section, so
  later changes to the default section for the student will affect
  that day.

## 0.0.13

- Change behavior such that changing the default student section will
  not affect any days for which that student already has an assigned
  team.  Note that this will only affect team assignments made by this
  version or later.

- Fix button label on renaming dialog.

## 0.0.11

- Fix bug in setting the week number initially.

## 0.0.10

- Fix bug where one user setting the week number simultaneously
  affects the views of other concurrent users of the app.

## 0.0.9

- Nicer icon with bigger light bulb.
- Fix bug where user authorization was not effective until some other
  change had been made, and was forgotten if app exits before that
  happens.

## 0.0.8

- Enable persistent login for faster startup.
